# Multiple IFTTT Triggers
IFTTT users have longed for the ability to trigger multiple actions from a single command, making it more like if-this-then-them. So you could for example, press a single button and trigger your lights to go off, your thermostat to turn off, and your security cameras to turn on.

Well, with this app and IFTTT Webhooks you can make that happen!

# Getting Started
You need to create a Webhook that notifies your Glitch app, which in turn triggers multiple services in IFTTT. For step-by-step instructions, see `SETUP.md`.
